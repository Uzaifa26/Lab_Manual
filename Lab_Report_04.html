    <hr>
    <h2 style="color: green; font-size: 18px;">Inline CSS Example</h2>
    <p style="color: green; font-size: 18px;">Morning is the beginning of a new day, bringing with it freshness, hope, and energy.<br>
    The rising sun spreads light across the sky, birds sing melodious songs, and the cool<br>
    breeze creates a calm and peaceful atmosphere. Morning is the best time to plan the<br>
    day, study, or enjoy a walk in nature. It reminds us that every day is a new chance to<br>
    learn, grow, and do better than yesterday.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Internal CSS Example</h2>
    <p class="internal">Nature is the beautiful world around us, full of mountains, rivers, forests, plants, and animals.<br>
    It provides us with fresh air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat. The colors of flowers,<br>
    the songs of birds, and the changing seasons make life peaceful and joyful. Nature is also our teacher,<br>
    showing us balance and harmony in everything. It is our responsibility to take care of it, so future<br>
    generations can enjoy the same beauty and benefits.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>External CSS Example</h3>
    <p>Night is the quiet time of the day when the sun sets, the sky turns dark, and stars begin to shine. It brings rest<br>
    and peace after a long day of work. The cool breeze and calm surroundings create a relaxing atmosphere, helping<br>
    people to refresh their minds and bodies. Night also gives us time to reflect, dream, and prepare for the<br>
    opportunities of a new day.</p>
